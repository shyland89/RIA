Implement dataset persistence and import history so analytics can be reloaded later and multiple uploads can be switched.

CONTEXT
- User uploads CSV and it imports into opportunities.
- We need each upload treated as a dataset/import run:
  - Stored server-side
  - User can log out and come back and still see last dataset
  - User can view previous imports and switch analytics between them
- Also support: “Replace existing” vs “Append”

DO NOW
1) Database
   - Confirm import_jobs table exists.
   - Ensure opportunities rows can link to an import job:
     - add import_job_id column to opportunities if missing (foreign key to import_jobs.id)
   - Add to import_jobs:
     - file_name
     - row_count
     - inserted_count
     - error_count
     - status (pending/running/completed/failed)
     - created_at
     - org_id

2) Import pipeline
   - When CSV import starts:
     - create import_jobs row (status=pending/running)
   - When done:
     - update inserted_count, error_count, status
   - Insert imported opportunities with import_job_id set.

3) “Replace vs Append”
   - Add a toggle on Import screen:
     - Replace existing data (soft delete or mark previous datasets inactive)
     - Append as new dataset
   - If Replace:
     - Do not destroy historical data; instead mark prior datasets inactive OR mark opportunities archived.

4) Analytics selection
   - Add “Dataset” selector dropdown on Analytics:
     - Default = latest successful import job for org
     - List recent import_jobs (file_name + created_at)
   - All analytics queries must include:
     - org_id
     - AND import_job_id = selected dataset
     - plus date filters + dimension filters

5) Import History page/section
   - Show table of import runs with status + counts + errors
   - Allow selecting an import to open analytics for that dataset

VERIFY
- Upload CSV -> dataset created.
- Refresh / log out & in -> analytics still show the last dataset.
- Upload second CSV with Append -> you can switch between dataset A and dataset B.
- Replace option does not delete history; it just changes what is active/default.
